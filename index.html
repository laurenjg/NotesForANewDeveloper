            Object oriented programming is a way of writing and organising<br>
            your code into objects that encapsulate data and interact<br>
            with one another.
          </small>
          <small>
            Benefits of programming with objects:<br>
            - Groups related data and actions<br>
            - Makes code 'objects' reusable<br>
            - Makes program easier to understand (in theory)<br>
            - Makes program easier to update, test, debug, fix and maintain<br>
            <br> 
            Every 'object' has:<br>
            - Properties (data)<br>
            - Methods (actions)<br>
            <br>
            What is an 'object'?<br>
            Think of an 'object' as a 'unit' of code, in JS this could be a collection<br>
            of key-value pairs (an object or map), in C# this could be an interface<br>
            (more on interfaces later)<br>
            <br> 
            What does it mean when a program is 'object oriented'?<br>
            - The code is made up of objects interacting<br>
            <br>

            Are there other ways of programming, if so what are they and how do they differ?<br>
            - Yes, for contextual understanding, there are multiple different programming<br>
            approaches for different including:<br>
            - Procedural programming<br>
            Code is essentially just a sequence of instructions<br>
            <br>
            - Functional programming<br>
            Code focuses on pure mathematical functions<br>
            Think python<br>
            <br>
            - Declarative programming<br>
            Code describes exactly what you want done and how to do it<br>
            Think SQL, HTML, CSS<br>
            <br>
            - Event-driven programming<br>
            Code responds to events like user actions, a common web development practice<br>
            Commonly implemented using OOP concepts<br>
            <br>
            - Component-based programming<br>
            Code is made up of reusable components<br>
            Thing, react or angular<br>
            Commonly implemented using OOP concepts</small>

          <small> Surely theres a better way to arrange all this code... </small>
